# WhiteCarrot Careers

A lightweight, multi-tenant careers page builder built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Supabase. Recruiters can create branded careers pages for their companies, manage flexible content sections, and post jobs that candidates can browse. Pages support company branding (logo, banner, colors), embedded culture videos, and rich content sections.

This project includes an admin editing UI with live previews, drag-and-drop CSV job import (with validation, preview, and bulk insert), and delightful animations powered by Framer Motion. It uses Supabase for auth, row-level security, and relational storage of companies, content sections, and jobsâ€”designed as a starter kit for ATS integrations or small recruiting teams.
